## Le Quang Huy

This repository demonstrates a **mini Agile project** using a **portfolio website UI** as the product and **Git Flow** as the collaboration workflow. The goal is to practice user stories, backlog management, pull requests, code reviews, and merge conflict resolution.

## 📌 Project Scope

* UI-only portfolio website
* No backend or database
* Focus on Agile planning and Git collaboration

## 🧩 Agile Backlog

The team managed tasks using a project board with the following columns:

* **Todo**: User stories not started
* **In Progress**: Tasks currently being implemented
* **Review**: Tasks with an open Pull Request
* **Done**: Tasks merged into `main`

Each task was written as a **User Story** and included Acceptance Criteria and a Definition of Done.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Agile practices and Git collaboration help teams stay organized, maintain code quality, and resolve conflicts effectively, even in a small UI-focused project.
